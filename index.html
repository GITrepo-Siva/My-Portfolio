            <h3>Understanding Heterogeneity and Anisotropy of Duplex Stainless Steel's Elastic/Plastic Nature through Property Mapping Technique</h3>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accelerated property mapping, an advanced indentation technique, was used to describe the nanomechanical behaviour of duplex stainless steel (DSS) surfaces prior to and post heat treatments. Heterogeneity in deformation responses and relative elastic and/or plastic nature of DSS was assessed on longitudinal and transverse directions through load–displacement curves, property maps, histograms of hardness (H), modulus (E), and indentation works. Empirical ratios such as H/E, (H/E)<sup>1/2</sup>, H<sup>3</sup>/E<sup>2</sup>, and plasticity index were employed to understand the anisotropy across the directions.</p>

            <h3>Heterogeneity and Anisotropy in Mechanical Behaviour of Austenite, Ferrite, and Inter-phase Regions of Duplex Stainless Steel Assessed Through Property Mapping Method</h3>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Property mapping, an indentation technique, was employed to investigate the nano-mechanical behaviour of austenite, ferrite, and interphase regions in duplex stainless steel (DSS). The influence of furnace cooling and water quenching heat treatment processes on the deformation behaviour of individual phase regions was quantitatively assessed in both the transverse and longitudinal sections of DSS samples. Property evaluation across these regions was conducted through load-displacement curves and associated material parameters such as empirical property ratios, elastic-plastic indentation work values, and other mechanical properties. This study reveals the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the mechanical behaviour of DSS phase regions across the sections, which can assist in improving structural design(s).</p>
